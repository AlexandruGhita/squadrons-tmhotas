# Star Wars Squadrons 
A ThrustMaster HOTAS Target Script

### What is this?
This is a TARGET script that blends roll and yaw to give your starfighter a similar handling to that of the old X-Wing/TIE Fighter games.

### Installation
Simply download the .tmc file and open it with the TARGET GUI. Click "run configuration" and open the .tmc file.

### Configuration
When starting Squadrons, make sure the FUEL switches are pushed forward to NORM.  Go to the flight stick configuration screen in Squadrons.  Configuration is straight forward with one exception: when mapping roll and yaw axis, you must flip the FUEL switches to OVERRIDE.  This will turn off the backlight on the throttle - this indicates roll/yaw blending is disabled.  It is important to do this so when assigning the roll/yaw axis, you only have input from one axis.  Configure your roll and yaw axis as desired, then flip the FUEL switches back to NORM.

Step by step:
1. Make sure FUEL switches are switched to NORM.
1. Start Squadrons
1. Go to flight stick configuration
1. FUEL switches -> OVERRIDE (backlight will go out)
1. Configure roll axis
1. Configure yaw axis
1. FUEL switches -> NORM
1. Configure the rest of your axis/buttons.
